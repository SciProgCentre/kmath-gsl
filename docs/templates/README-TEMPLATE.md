## Additional requirements

On Linux, final binaries using `kmath-gsl` need a BLAS implementation installed (because of dynamic linking
to `libblas`). To achieve better performance, MKL or ATLAS can be used.

On Windows, default CBLAS provided by GSL is linked statically. To build the kmath-gsl itself on Windows it is required
to have [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) installed and added to Path (uncomment the `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit` line in
mingw64.ini) and GSL installed manually in the MSYS shell:

```shell
pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gsl
```

## Multiplatform support

Currently, only `linuxX64` and `mingwX64` Kotlin targets are supported. It is also planned to support `macosX64`,
and `jvm` (with [JEP-389](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/389)).
